Example usage: `./example_quadtree.pl 13 | gs`

You'll need SWI-Prolog and a postscript viewer for the quadtree example.

The houses example runs an HTTP server and serves an SVG to your browser. Run `./example_houses.pl`, optionally pass the port number, then open `localhost:9987` in your browser (or whatever port number you passed in).
